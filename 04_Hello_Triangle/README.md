So far, we created a Window and added an OpenGL widget to it. We also re-implemented the methods we need to render OpenGL. <br>
Now we try to port the triangle example.<br>

### Vertices

### Vertex Buffer Object

### Vertex Shader

### Fragment Shader

### Shader Program

### Verted Array Objects

### And, the triangle!
